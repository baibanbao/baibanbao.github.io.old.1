Goodbye doesn't always mean forever.
There will always be another place and time
where questions will be answered,
the unspoken shall be spoken,
letters shall be read,
undone poems will be recited in the night,
songs shall be sung in harmony,
love will be expressed in solitude and
promises shall be fulfilled.
Somewhere. Somehow. Someday.
