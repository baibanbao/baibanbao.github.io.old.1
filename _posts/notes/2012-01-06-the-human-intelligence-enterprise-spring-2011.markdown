[The Human Intelligence Enterprise: Spring 2011](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.803/)

This book list is recommended by a MIT professor. I like the personalization and vividness in it. It's also very informative. From this list I have known a great scientific writer: James Watson. I downloaded his major works and prepare to read them as detective novels.
