[Kim Jong Il | The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21542161)

Sarcastic, cynical, bitter, and black-humorous, the obituary of Kim Jong II is written skillfully and dramatically.





The theme is playing a role. The order, time sequence. The model, a circle.





This article worth reading for 10 times if anyone what to learn the essence of English humor.





Is everything written here true. That's not important.
