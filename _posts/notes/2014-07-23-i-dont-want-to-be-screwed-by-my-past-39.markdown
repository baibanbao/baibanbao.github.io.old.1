The past weekend was a such a memorable time to me. I broke up my principle and participated a classmate meeting in Qingdao. The result was long-lasting depression to me. I regret to the renion to my classmates. I even don't want to talk about it.

I am a writer and it's a duty for me to write up all my feelings no matter joyful or moody. But this time I don't want to write anything. i died as an young fellow and I don't miss that bastard. That's what I feel. 

I WILL NEVER MAKE THIS KIND OF MISTAKE AGAIN. NEVER.
